      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to add styles and enhance the presentation of HTML
          documents. It is a stylesheet language that defines how the elements of a webpage should be displayed.
          CSS allows you to control various aspects of the appearance of your webpages, such as colors, fonts,
          layouts, and more.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS Syntax</h3>
        <pre>
          selector {
            property: value;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In CSS, you select HTML elements using selectors and apply styles to them using properties and values.
          Selectors can be based on element names, classes, IDs, attributes, and more. Properties define the visual
          appearance and behavior of the selected elements, and values specify how those properties should be applied.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section id="css_selectors">
      <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS selectors are used to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. There are various types
          of CSS selectors available, including element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and more.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Element Selector */
          h1 {
            color: blue;
          }

          /* Class Selector */
          .highlight {
            background-color: yellow;
          }

          /* ID Selector */
          #header {
            font-size: 24px;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the first rule selects all `<h1>` elements and applies a blue color. The second rule
          targets elements with the class "highlight" and applies a yellow background color. The third rule selects
          an element with the ID "header" and sets the font size to 24 pixels.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section id="css_properties">
      <h2>CSS Properties</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS properties define the visual appearance and behavior of HTML elements. There are numerous CSS
          properties available to control different aspects, such as colors, sizes, margins, padding, and more.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Color Property */
          p {
            color: blue;
          }

          /* Font-size Property */
          h1 {
            font-size: 24px;
          }

          /* Margin Property */
          .container {
            margin: 10px;
          }

          /* Padding Property */
          .box {
            padding: 20px;
          }

          /* Background-color Property */
          body {
            background-color: #f7f7f7;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, different CSS properties are used. The `color` property sets the text color of `<p>`
          elements to blue. The `font-size` property sets the font size of `<h1>` elements to 24 pixels. The `margin`
          property sets a margin of 10 pixels for elements with the class "container". The `padding` property sets a
          padding of 20 pixels for elements with the class "box". The `background-color` property sets the background
          color of the `body` element to a light gray (#f7f7f7).
        </p>

    </section>
    <section id="css_layout">
      <h2>CSS Layout</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS layout techniques are used to control the positioning and arrangement of elements on a webpage. CSS
          provides various layout options, including floats, positioning, flexbox, and grid.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Float Property */
          .image {
            float: left;
          }

          /* Position Property */
          .box {
            position: absolute;
            top: 50%;
            left: 50%;
            transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
          }

          /* Flexbox Property */
          .container {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
          }

          /* Grid Property */
          .grid-container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
            grid-gap: 10px;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, different CSS layout properties are used. The `float` property floats the elements with
          the class "image" to the left. The `position` property positions the elements with the class "box"
          absolutely and centers them using the `top`, `left`, and `transform` properties. The `display`, `justify-content`,
          and `align-items` properties create a centered layout using flexbox for elements with the class "container".
          The `display`, `grid-template-columns`, and `grid-gap` properties create a grid layout for elements with the
          class "grid-container", with two columns and a gap of 10 pixels between grid items.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section id="css_box_model">
      <h2>CSS Box Model</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          The CSS box model describes the structure and layout of HTML elements. It consists of the content area,
          padding, border, and margin. Understanding the box model is essential for controlling element sizing and
          spacing.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Width and Height Properties */
          .box {
            width: 200px;
            height: 150px;
          }

          /* Padding Property */
          .box {
            padding: 20px;
          }

          /* Border Property */
          .box {
            border: 1px solid #ccc;
          }

          /* Margin Property */
          .box {
            margin: 10px;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the CSS properties related to the box model are used. The `width` property sets the
          width of elements with the class "box" to 200 pixels. The `height` property sets the height of the elements
          to 150 pixels. The `padding` property creates a padding of 20 pixels around the content area of the elements.
          The `border` property adds a 1 pixel solid border with the color #ccc. The `margin` property adds a margin of
          10 pixels outside the border of the elements.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section id="css_flexbox">
      <h2>CSS Flexbox</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS Flexbox is a powerful layout module that provides a flexible way to arrange and distribute space among
          elements in a container. It is particularly useful for building responsive and dynamic layouts.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Container Properties */
          .container {
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: row;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
          }

          /* Item Properties */
          .item {
            flex: 1;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the CSS properties related to flexbox are used. The `display` property set to `flex`
          enables flexbox layout for elements with the class "container". The `flex-direction` property sets the
          direction of the flex items in the container to be horizontal (row). The `justify-content` property centers
          the flex items horizontally within the container, and the `align-items` property centers them vertically.
          The `flex` property with a value of 1 is applied to elements with the class "item" to distribute the available
          space equally among them.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section id="css_grid">
      <h2>CSS Grid</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create complex grid-based layouts with ease.
          It offers precise control over the placement and alignment of elements in both rows and columns.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Container Properties */
          .container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
            grid-gap: 10px;
          }

          /* Item Properties */
          .item {
            grid-column: span 1;
            grid-row: span 2;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the CSS properties related to CSS Grid are used. The `display` property set to `grid`
          enables grid layout for elements with the class "container". The `grid-template-columns` property specifies
          the width of each column, with `1fr` indicating an equal fraction of the available space. The `grid-gap`
          property sets the gap between grid items. The `grid-column` property with a value of `span 1` specifies that
          the items with the class "item" should occupy 1 column, and the `grid-row` property with a value of `span 2`
          specifies that the items should occupy 2 rows.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section id="css_media_queries">
      <h2>CSS Media Queries</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or viewport
          on which your webpage is being displayed. Media queries are commonly used for creating responsive designs
          that adapt to different screen sizes.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Default Styles */
          p {
            font-size: 16px;
          }

          /* Media Query */
          @media (max-width: 768px) {
            /* Styles for devices with a maximum width of 768px */
            p {
              font-size: 14px;
            }
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the default font size for `<p>` elements is set to 16 pixels. However, within the media
          query, which targets devices with a maximum width of 768 pixels, the font size is adjusted to 14 pixels.
          This allows the text to be displayed at a smaller size on smaller screens or devices.
        </p>

    </section>
    <section id="css_animations">
      <h2>CSS Animations</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS animations enable you to create dynamic and interactive effects on your webpages. With CSS animations,
          you can animate various properties of HTML elements, such as position, size, opacity, and more.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Keyframes */
          @keyframes slide-in {
            0% {
              transform: translateX(-100%);
            }
            100% {
              transform: translateX(0);
            }
          }

          /* Animation */
          .box {
            animation: slide-in 1s ease-in-out;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, a keyframe animation called "slide-in" is defined using the `@keyframes` rule. The keyframe
          animation specifies the transformation of an element from being translated 100% to the left (-100%) to its original
          position (0) over a duration of 1 second. The animation is then applied to elements with the class "box" using
          the `animation` property, with a duration of 1 second, an easing function of ease-in-out, and the "slide-in"
          animation name.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section id="css_transitions">
      <h2>CSS Transitions</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS transitions allow you to smoothly animate changes in CSS properties over a specified duration. With transitions, you can control how elements change from one style to another when triggered by events like hovering or clicking.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Transition */
          .box {
            transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
          }
    
          /* Hover Effect */
          .box:hover {
            background-color: lightblue;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, when hovering over an element with the class "box," the background color will smoothly transition to light blue over a duration of 0.3 seconds.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    
    <section id="css_variables">
      <h2>CSS Variables (Custom Properties)</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS variables, also known as custom properties, allow you to define reusable values in your CSS stylesheets. Using variables can make your styles more maintainable and flexible, as you can easily change multiple styles by updating a single variable.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Define a Variable */
          :root {
            --primary-color: #007bff;
          }
    
          /* Use the Variable */
          .button {
            background-color: var(--primary-color);
            color: white;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, we define a CSS variable named "--primary-color" with the value "#007bff." This variable is then used to set the background color of buttons with the class "button," making it easier to update the primary color across the entire stylesheet.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    
    <section id="css_filter">
      <h2>CSS Filter</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS filters allow you to apply visual effects to elements, such as adjusting brightness, contrast, blur, and more. Filters can be used to create unique and artistic effects on images and other content.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Filter */
          .image {
            filter: grayscale(50%) blur(2px);
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the class "image" applies a grayscale filter with 50% intensity and a blur filter with a radius of 2 pixels to the image.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    
    <section id="css_blend_modes">
      <h2>CSS Blend Modes</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS blend modes allow you to control how elements blend with their background and other elements. Blend modes are particularly useful when overlaying elements with transparency.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Blend Mode */
          .overlay {
            background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);
            mix-blend-mode: screen;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the class "overlay" sets the background color with 50% transparency (rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)) and applies the "screen" blend mode to blend the element's color with the background color.
        </p>
      </article>

    <section id="css_pseudo_classes_elements">
      <h2>CSS Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements allow you to target and style elements based on their state or position in the document. Pseudo-classes target elements that are not part of the HTML structure, such as when an element is hovered over or in a specific state. Pseudo-elements, on the other hand, target specific parts of an element, such as its before or after content.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Pseudo-class */
          a:hover {

          p::before {
            content: "»";
            margin-right: 5px;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the "hover" pseudo-class underlines links when hovered over. The "::before" pseudo-element adds a "»" symbol before each paragraph.

        <p>
          CSS transforms allow you to manipulate the position, size, and rotation of elements. Transforms can be used to create engaging visual effects and animations.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Transform */
          .box {
            transform: translateX(50px) rotate(45deg);
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the class "box" translates the element 50 pixels to the right (translateX) and rotates it 45 degrees clockwise.

    <section id="css_columns">
      <h2>CSS Columns</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS columns allow you to create multi-column layouts within a single element. This is particularly useful for displaying text content in a newspaper or magazine-like format.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Columns */
          .content {
            columns: 2;
            column-gap: 20px;
          }

    <section id="css_image_sprites">
      <h2>CSS Image Sprites</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS image sprites are used to combine multiple images into a single image file and then display specific parts of that image as background images for different elements. Using image sprites can reduce the number of HTTP requests, leading to improved performance.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* Sprite Image */
          .sprite {
            background-image: url("sprites.png");
            background-position: -20px -40px;
            width: 30px;
            height: 30px;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the class "sprite" uses the "sprites.png" image as a background image and positions it to display a specific part of the image (-20px from the left and -40px from the top). The width and height properties are set to define the size of the displayed image portion.

      <h2>CSS Responsive Design</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          Responsive design is a fundamental concept in modern web development. It aims to create websites that adapt and look great on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. CSS plays a crucial role in achieving responsive layouts and styling.
        </p>
        <h3>Viewport Meta Tag</h3>
        <p>
          The viewport meta tag allows you to control the layout on mobile browsers and adjust the initial scale to fit the screen properly.
        </p>
        <pre>
          &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
        </pre>
        <h3>Responsive Units</h3>
        <p>
          CSS offers several units that are useful for responsive design. Some commonly used units include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Percentages (%): Relative to the parent element's size.</li>
          <li>Viewport Width (vw) and Viewport Height (vh): Relative to the size of the viewport.</li>
          <li>Rem and Em: Relative to the root or parent element's font size, respectively.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Media Queries for Responsive Styling</h3>
        <p>
          Media queries are a key aspect of responsive design. They allow you to apply different styles based on the screen size or device capabilities.
        </p>
        <pre>
          /* Example Media Query */
          @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
            /* Styles for screens with a maximum width of 768px */
            .header {
              font-size: 16px;
            }
            .menu {
              display: none;
            }
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, the font size for the header and the display property for the menu will change when the screen width is 768 pixels or less.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    
    <section id="css_print_styles">
      <h2>CSS Print Styles</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          While CSS is mainly used for styling webpages for screen display, it also has the capability to style printed documents. Print styles allow you to create printer-friendly versions of your webpages, optimizing them for paper output.
        </p>
        <h3>Media Queries for Print</h3>
        <p>
          You can use media queries specifically for print styles to target print devices and adjust the layout and appearance.
        </p>
        <pre>
          /* Example Print Styles */
          @media print {
            body {
              font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;
              font-size: 12pt;
              color: #000;
            }
            .header, .footer {
              display: none;
            }
            /* Additional print-specific styles... */
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, we modify the font family, font size, and text color for the printed document. Additionally, the header and footer elements are set to be hidden when printed.
        </p>

    <section id="css_vendor_prefixes">
      <h2>CSS Vendor Prefixes</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          Vendor prefixes are used to implement CSS properties that are still experimental or have limited browser support. They are necessary to ensure that your styles work across different browsers during the testing and experimental phase of new CSS features.
        </p>
        <h3>Common Vendor Prefixes</h3>
        <p>
          Some of the most common vendor prefixes are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>-webkit-: Used by Safari and some versions of Chrome.</li>
          <li>-moz-: Used by Firefox.</li>
          <li>-o-: Used by Opera.</li>
          <li>-ms-: Used by Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge (legacy versions).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* CSS Property with Vendor Prefixes */
          .box {
            -webkit-border-radius: 5px;
            -moz-border-radius: 5px;
            border-radius: 5px;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, we apply a border radius to the ".box" class using the vendor prefixes for WebKit and Mozilla browsers, as well as the standard "border-radius" property.

    <section id="css_feature_detection">
      <h2>CSS Feature Detection</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS feature detection involves checking whether a particular CSS feature is supported by the user's browser before applying it. This technique helps to prevent potential CSS-related errors in unsupported browsers.
        </p>
        <h3>Using Modernizr for Feature Detection</h3>
        <p>
          Modernizr is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies feature detection for CSS and HTML5 features. It adds classes to the <html> element based on the supported features, allowing you to apply different styles accordingly.
        </p>
        <pre>
          &lt;html class="no-js"&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
          The "no-js" class is added by default, indicating that JavaScript is enabled. Modernizr then adds other classes based on feature support, such as "cssgradients" or "no-cssgradients", depending on whether CSS gradients are supported or not.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          /* CSS Feature Detection with Modernizr */
          .box {
            background-color: #f7f7f7;
          }
          .no-cssgradients .box {
            /* Fallback background style for browsers without CSS gradients support */
            background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #f7f7f7, #ffffff);
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, we apply a background color to the ".box" class by default. Then, using the "no-cssgradients" class provided by Modernizr, we provide a fallback background style using linear gradients for browsers that don't support CSS gradients.
        </p>

    <section id="css_fonts_and_typography">
      <h2>CSS Fonts and Typography</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          Typography is a crucial aspect of web design, and CSS provides a range of properties to control fonts and text appearance. Properly styling typography enhances readability and user experience on your website.
        </p>
        <h3>Font Families</h3>
        <p>
          CSS allows you to specify multiple font families to ensure cross-platform and cross-browser compatibility. The browser will try to use the first font, and if it's not available, it will move on to the next one in the list.
        </p>
        <pre>
          body {
            font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif;
          }
        </pre>
        <h3>Google Fonts</h3>
        <p>
          Google Fonts is a popular web font service that provides a wide selection of free and open-source fonts. You can easily integrate Google Fonts into your CSS to use custom typography on your website.
        </p>
        <pre>
          /* Link to Google Fonts in HTML head */
          &lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
    
          /* CSS Usage */
          body {
            font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, we load the "Roboto" font from Google Fonts and apply it to the body element using CSS.
        </p>
        <h3>Font Weight and Style</h3>
        <p>
          You can control the font weight and style to create visual emphasis or to differentiate between headings and body text.
        </p>
        <pre>
          h1 {
            font-weight: 700;
          }
          em {
            font-style: italic;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, we set the font weight of <h1> headings to 700 (bold) and apply an italic font style to <em> elements.
        </p>
        <h3>Text Alignment and Decoration</h3>
        <p>
          CSS provides properties to align text and add text decorations such as underline, overline, and line-through.
        </p>
        <pre>
          p {
            text-align: center;
            text-decoration: underline;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In the example above, we center-align the text in paragraphs and add an underline decoration.

          CSS preprocessors are compiled into standard CSS before deployment, which means that the browser receives regular CSS
          that it can understand. The use of preprocessors can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code, especially for large
          projects, by promoting code reusability and modularity.

      <h2>CSS Methodologies</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS methodologies are standardized approaches for writing CSS that aim to improve code organization, maintainability,
          and collaboration among developers. They often include naming conventions and rules for structuring CSS classes and
          selectors.
        </p>
        <h3>Popular CSS Methodologies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>BEM (Block Element Modifier)</li>
          <li>OOCSS (Object-Oriented CSS)</li>
          <li>SuitCSS</li>
          <li>SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS)</li>
          <li>Atomic CSS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          CSS methodologies help to create more scalable and maintainable CSS codebases by promoting a consistent and modular
          approach to styling. They can be particularly beneficial when working in large teams or on long-term projects.

      <h2>CSS Browser Support</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          CSS features are implemented differently in various web browsers, and not all browsers support the latest CSS
          specifications. When developing CSS for a website, it's essential to consider the browser support for the features
          you are using.
        </p>
        <h3>Dealing with Browser Compatibility</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure a consistent user experience across different browsers, developers often use techniques such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Progressive Enhancement: Providing a basic, functional experience for all users and enhancing it with more
            advanced features for modern browsers.</li>
          <li>Graceful Degradation: Building with modern features and ensuring that the site still functions in older browsers,
            albeit with a simplified appearance or fewer features.</li>
          <li>Using Vendor Prefixes: Adding vendor-specific prefixes to CSS properties to support experimental or non-standard
            features in different browsers (e.g., -webkit-, -moz-, -o-, -ms-).</li>
          <li>Feature Detection: Using JavaScript to detect if certain CSS features are supported and applying fallback styles
            if they are not.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By employing these practices, developers can create websites that perform well and look good across a wide range of
          browsers and devices.
